# Binary-Classification-using-ML-Algorithms

1.This project is about binary classification of data using several ML algorithms like Perceptron Learning Algorithm, Adaptive Linear Neuron algorithm and its batch and cyclic variants.


2.Bagging and Adaptive boosting is used to further improve accuracy.


3.Binary classification is also implemented using several variants in Support Vector Machines like primal linear hard SVM , dual linear hard margin SVM, kernel SVM(linear and Gaussian kernel)
